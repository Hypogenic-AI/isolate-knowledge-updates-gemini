\section{Experimental Details}
\label{sec:appendix_details}

We utilized the \easyedit library with the default configuration for \rome on \gptxl. The specific layer targeted was Layer 17, which has been identified in prior work as a critical site for factual associations. We used a single edit step with default clamping and covariance statistics derived from the Wikitext dataset.
